										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Week two, still working out the plan for Holoseat v2.  We have our epics defined, and a good idea of our priorities.  Things are going slower than in the past, but between busy lives and a three hour time difference it is a pace we can maintain.  A new tool to keep us organized, and more careful planning to allow for our limited time to be used as best we can.</p>



<h3><strong>New Tool</strong></h3>



<p>Good chance people recognize the tool in the screenshot.  We&#8217;re shifting our planning out of a custom Google Sheets document and into Jira.  Why the change?  Easier to access, easier to work with, and most importantly, it&#8217;s a tool we both use for work at this point so we know it pretty well.</p>



<h3>Last Meeting</h3>



<p>This past meeting we tweaked our original list of goals for v2.0 and decided on priorities.  We also decided that meeting weekly for this stretch of Thursday night is working well and we&#8217;ll continue for the foreseeable future.  We may change to a less frequent cadence once planning is complete, but until we get everything planned we will continue at the weekly pace.</p>



<h3>Next Meeting</h3>



<p>Much like the last two, we&#8217;re going to continue planning this week.  Now that we have overall goals, we need to setup the stories that define them and the bite size pieces we&#8217;re going to use to eat the elephant.  Planning continues, same bat time same bat channel. Thursday night 9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Eastern (6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Pacific) on our Discord server (leave a comment if you would like to join us). If you don&#8217;t currently have access and would like it, please either reach out to one of us directly or post a comment and we will send you an invite.</p>



<p>Thanks again for all of your continued support!  #ExerfyYourGames</p>

<p>Bryan and I have not closed up shop, we were merely on a hiatus…. Having children and making cross country moves will tend to put a kink in one&#8217;s plans.</p>



<p>That hiatus ends this week. We learned much during the v1.0 Alpha and in the time since then. So much that we have come to realize we need to iterate on a couple of specific elements in the design to make Holoseat more robust and more affordable.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we will be holding a v2 development kickoff meeting this Thursday night 9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Eastern (6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Pacific) on our Discord server (leave a comment if you would like to join us). We will be setting up our Jira project by defining our release goal(s) and setting the top level features (detailed agenda below).</p>



<h3>Agenda</h3>



<ol><li>Define goal(s) for v2.0</li><li>Capture v2.0 Features</li><li>Prioritize v2.0 Features</li><li>Establish meeting cadence</li></ol>



<p>Thanks again for all of your continued support!  #ExerfyYourGames</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first third of our 2019 planning year is coming to a close and it is time for our first Review/Retrospective covering the last two months of work.  After this, we will go dark for December to enjoy the holidays and rest up before the second third of our planning year (January &#8211; April).</p>
<p>With our work transitioning from development to testing and marketing, we have shifted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_Sprint">Scrum based sprints</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a> based iterations.  This post will cover the results and lessons from two Kanbans, 1.1 and 1.2.  As always, you can get all the details by from our <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/category/stand-ups/">weekly stand ups</a>.</p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>Agile reviews are an opportunity to hold ourselves accountable by identifying how much of what we planned we actually completed.</p>
<h2>Claiming Done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setup <a href="http://alpha.holoseat.com">alpha.holoseat.com</a> and back end surveys to capture feedback from Alpha Testers</li>
<li>Published first Alpha Tester guest blog post, <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/working-out-with-a-wargen-in-world-of-warcraft/">Working Out with a Wargen in World of Warcraft</a></li>
<li>Opened weekly stand up meetings to Alpha Testers</li>
<li>Began relocating corporation to address logistics issues with current location</li>
<li>Conducted research on better utilizing social media resources to build following ahead of crowd funding campaign</li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/holoseat-testimonials/">Holoseat Testimonials</a> page (thanks to our testers for sharing their stories)</li>
<li>Started the &#8220;<a href="https://www.modelb.biz/tag/how-i-holoseat/">How I Holoseat</a>&#8221; blog series to share testimonials on the blog</li>
<li>Research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing">influencer marketing</a></li>
<li>Submitted Holoseat to <a href="https://hackaday.com">Hackaday</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Not Claiming done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Relocation of the corporation (blocked on state government)</li>
<li>Holoseat trademark (blocked on relocation of the corporation)</li>
<li>Build Facebook community around Alpha Testers (dropped from plan, going to rework the plan)</li>
<li>Wrap up final paperwork related to Alpha Test</li>
</ul>
<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<p>Agile retrospectives are the means by which we &#8220;inspect and adapt&#8221;.  This is our chance to promote what works and adjust what does not.</p>
<h2>What went well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Great first guest blog post</li>
<li>Good use of research into moving businesses between states turned into huge time savings in the process (domestication vs reincorporation)</li>
<li>Good use of inspect and adapt mid-iteration around use of social media when planned activities were not working</li>
<li>Did a good job of sticking to PY19 goals of focusing on marketing and business (notice we did not claim done on any technical items in this iteration)</li>
<li>Happy with how the testimonials page/How I Holoseat combo turned out</li>
<li>Our unfinished work is predominantly items that were blocked or we reworked the plan (vs just things we did not get around to)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What did not go well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We really must improve how we go about doing social media and marketing</li>
<li>Uneven distribution of workload due to extenuating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<h2>What can we do better?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bring a marketer on board</li>
<li>Try moving to 2 stand ups per week during PY19 Kanban 2.1 and evaluate if this helps with workload distribution</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second in a series of posts recapping our 2017 Holoseat development and sharing our 2018 plan. In the <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/back-oshw-projects-tale-part-1/">first post</a> we covered our 2017 goals and the reasons behind them. Today’s post is about how we achieved those goals, just in time for SyndCon 2017.</em></p>
<p>While 2017 was a huge success, I was completely surprised by the specifics of how we accomplished our goals.  As a quick recap, here are our goals for 2017.</p>
<ol>
<li>Finalize the hardware design needed to address the key feedback from demos at SyndCon 2016.</li>
<li>Run a private beta test program for Holoseat to vet the design before releasing version 1.0.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what happened?  We started the year with some less than great technical and business assumptions.  On the technical front, we were convinced we needed to upgrade out of the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771">Adafruit Feather</a> to a full on system-on-a-chip controller board.  And on the business side, we allowed ourselves to be caught up in the siren&#8217;s song of crowd source campaigns too soon.  Sadly, these assumptions took us down rabbit holes most of the year.  Fortunately we caught ourselves in time for a <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/good-news-everyone-holoseat-syndcon-2017/">great SyndCon 2017</a>.</p>
<h1>Finalizing the Hardware Design</h1>
<p>We started 2017 chasing down two seemingly unrelated design issues:  profile management and Holoseat&#8217;s sensitivity to pedaling activity.  Profile management covers things like trigger cadence (how fast an individual has to pedal to trigger walking).  And Holoseat&#8217;s sensitivity to pedaling actions impacts how long it takes Holoseat to recognize changes in pedaling.  Bryan and I focused the first half of 2017 on addressing profile management.  This effort took the form of redesigning Holoseat around a brand new family of development boards:  the <a href="https://getchip.com/pages/chip">CHIP</a>/<a href="https://getchip.com/pages/chippro">CHIP Pro</a>.   Moving to the CHIP boards involved redesigning basically everything about Holoseat and led to an enormous amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep">scope creep</a>.  I could write pages retrospecting how exactly we got to that point, but that&#8217;s another blog post.</p>
<p>We were still testing the fundamental technologies we needed for a CHIP based Holoseat with only 8 weeks to go until SyndCon.  To say we were off plan is an understatement.   Things turned around when Bryan took charge of designing a custom tone ring to use with a new sensor.  Within four weeks we had a working prototype for these sensor upgrades, versus the four months we spent working on the move to CHIP.  More importantly, the new design&#8217;s improved sensitivity yielded unexpected benefits.  Namely, Holoseat was now responsive enough to calculate trigger cadence in real time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-330 aligncenter" src="https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/holoseatv0.3.5-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="338" srcset="https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/holoseatv0.3.5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/holoseatv0.3.5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/holoseatv0.3.5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/holoseatv0.3.5-580x435.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>We quickly realized this &#8220;adaptive cadence&#8221; capability meant we could drop profile management and go back (<em>again</em>) to our original Feather based design.  After conducting additional testing we also concluded we had arrived at our minimum viable product (SyndCon prototype shown above).  And what became of all of the effort we put into researching the CHIP boards? A large chunk of that work went into mastering Python in IoT applications. It didn’t take us long to realize the bulk of that work could be re-purposed into the development of a brand new, and feature complete, desktop configuration app. Further, thanks to Python’s portability, the same app will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. And should we need to revisit a CHIP based Holoseat, it will work there, too.</p>
<h1>Setting Up Our Testing Program</h1>
<div style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/building-a-hardware-business.csp"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium" src="http://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/0636920042402/cat.gif" width="180" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Great Read for OSHW Start Ups</p></div>
<p>One of the things we have to keep in mind is Holoseat is more than just a technical project. It is also a business and an investment of our time and money. This means we divide our effort between technical and business matters. For example, 2017 included research into preparing for and running crowd source campaigns. One of our conclusions from this research was we were not ready to run a crowd source campaign in 2017. We simply did not have a large enough online following to form the foundation of a successful campaign.</p>
<p>What we did have was a supportive core of fans asking us when they could get their own Holoseats. The value of this core group of supporters became apparent to us after reading <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/building-a-hardware-business.csp">Building a Hardware Business</a>.  The authors discuss different growth strategies including building on a small core of passionate users.  This strategy resonated with us and we decided it was time to organize our core fans into a testing community.</p>
<p>So, we put together our Alpha Test Program and offered 5 slots at SyndCon. We came home with 8 deposits for Alpha units. One fan even tried to give us his money during our annual Holoseat presentation! <em>#winning</em>  Having 8 high quality testers is going to be significantly better for us in the long run.  Now the race is on to complete v1 Alpha so our testers can get their hands, er feet, on Holoseat.</p>

<p><em>Stay tuned for Part 3 where we lay out the 2018 plan and cover how we are doing so far.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are going into November after hoping to be shipping our Alpha product by December&#8230;  So will we make it?  If you have been following the development posts on <a href="http://dev.holoseat.com">http://dev.holoseat.com</a> (click the <strong>News</strong> link at the top) then you know the answer.  If not, it can be summed up in a single word, and it isn&#8217;t the one we wanted &#8212; no.  We&#8217;ve tried, but we massively underestimated how much work their was to do along with overestimating our ability to complete it.  So if we&#8217;re not done, then where are we?</p>
<h1>Alpha Prototype Progress</h1>
<p>First, we&#8217;ve got our prototyping done for most of our design changes.  And, we have some nice pictures so you can see for yourself how we are coming along.</p>
<p>The article picture shows our updated prototype setup on a breadboard using the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRRS cable</a> to connect the controller to the sensor and the new <a href="http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cherry MX key switch</a> for enabling Holoseat.  Using a network jack (look in the upper right corner) we connected it to the existing setup from one of our <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/good-news-everyone-holoseat-syndcon-2017/">SyndCon demo units</a> and I used it for a few hours.  Worked just as smooth as our assembled units, so we know these changes didn&#8217;t mess with a good thing.</p>
<p>Speaking of the key switch, did we happen to mention that we&#8217;re doing a custom keycap with the holoseat h?  Here&#8217;s what it looks like lit up on our couple of test key switches we were trying out:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-363 aligncenter" src="https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JPEG_20171203_205942-226x300.jpg" alt="Glowing h Keycap" width="226" height="300" srcset="https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JPEG_20171203_205942-226x300.jpg 226w, https://www.modelb.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JPEG_20171203_205942.jpg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></p>
<p>That covers the main electronics review.  But what about the little bit of magic that pushed our accuracy up to the point where everything smoothed out?  The tone ring has gotten a bit of a makeover too.  We have split it into two pieces.</p>

</table>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why&#8217;d we split it?  We wanted  to have a cover over the magnets so they couldn&#8217;t come out.  It wasn&#8217;t an issue during the demos, but we felt that was a poor choice to have them pressure fitted like they were long term.  These are straight 3D prints from the drawings, so they&#8217;re still a little rough looking.  But you can get an idea for how the final tone ring will work.</p>
<h1>Next Steps &amp; Getting Involved in the Alpha</h1>
<p>So that covers our progress so far.  But it still leaves quite a bit left to do.  And the majority of the remaining work is less about hardware development and more about getting ready to take on testers, getting our redesigned desktop software into shape, and sorting out a few things on the business side.</p>
<p>Moving forward what we need from those of you who follow this blog is some help.  Here&#8217;s a few spots where can make a difference for Holoseat:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Do you have some ideas for questions we should be asking our Alpha testing users during the test program?  Post them here &lt;link to google form for submitting questions&gt;.</li>
<li>Enjoy 3D modeling?  We could use your help porting our mechanical designs from Solidworks to  Autodesk Fusion 360.  Our volunteer mCAD modeler prefers Solidworks, but it is not an open platform, so we need to move our mCAD models.  If this sounds like something you would like to help out with, please fill out the volunteer form indicating you want to help with mCAD &lt;form link&gt;.</li>
<li>Do you have a knack for python and enjoy development? Consider volunteering to help with the desktop application.  Again, the volunteer link is here.</li>
<li>In the DC or Blacksburg, VA area and want to help with final assembly and shipping?  We&#8217;ll take volunteers for that too!  I&#8217;m guessing you know where this is going.</li>
</ul>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re behind (no Holoseats for Christmas), but we&#8217;re moving forward at a good pace.   We would rather be a couple of months late with a Holoseat you will love than ship something substandard on schedule.</p>
<p>Looking at the novel I&#8217;ve just written, it&#8217;s time to get back to work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the first in a series of posts recapping our 2017 Holoseat development and sharing our 2018 plan. In this post we look at the plan for 2017, aimed at taking a near production version of Holoseat to SyndCon 2017.</em></p>
<p>This past February we posted about our <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/arduino-chip-looking-back-2016-kicking-off-2017/">progress during 2016 and our plans for 2017</a>. In that post we identified two key goals for 2017, to be completed by SyndCon in August. Those goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finalize the hardware design needed to address the key feedback from demos at SyndCon 2016.</li>
<li>Run a private beta test program for Holoseat to vet the design before releasing version 1.0.</li>
</ol>
<p>So how did we do? We got back from SyndCon a few weeks ago and I am happy to report it was a complete success. But I must admit, the way we achieved that success and the Holoseat we took to SyndCon were quite different than what I envisioned when we wrote that post back in February. To understand why it is best we take a look at each goal one at a time.</p>
<h1>Goal 1 &#8211; Finalize Hardware Design</h1>
<p>Two pieces of feedback drove the hardware design work called for in the first goal. The first piece of feedback was an unanticipated need to tweak Holoseat’s settings every time we changed players or games. One setting in particular, trigger cadence &#8211; the pedaling speed required for Holoseat to recognize a player is walking, took half of the demo time to dial in during most demos. Our intended solution was to migrate from an Arduino controller board to a significantly more powerful one, the <a href="https://getchip.com/pages/chippro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHIP Pro</a>.  This change would enable on board management of player specific profiles. These profiles would capture each individual player’s settings per game enabling players to switch out Holoseat settings as easily as they switched between games.</p>
<p>The second piece of feedback driving Goal 1 was a desire for faster response times from Holoseat.  Take a look at the video below to see the v0.3 response times for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Holoseat v0.3 Response Time" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FrjTI86OOA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>While not captured in the February blog post, we had a line of research lined up to address this request.   But, we prioritized this research lower than incorporating the new controller board. The irony of this decision will become apparent in Part 2 of this series of blog posts.</p>
<h1>Goal 2 &#8211; Run the Beta Test</h1>
<p>How would you fund the development and manufacturing of a beta design for a new hardware project? If your answer is “KickStarter!” you are very close to where we were in our thinking last February.</p>
<p>Sadly, running a successful crowd source campaign takes more time, and a greater social media presence, than we had in 2017. Thankfully we came to this realization (through careful research) before we got too far into the year. At the time we thought we were completely blocked on this goal.  So, we spent most of 2017 assuming we would have to wait at least a year before we could engage outside players as testers.</p>
<p>But in agile projects like Holoseat, being blocked does not mean things are hopeless. Blocks are meant to be resolved and once they are you can get back to working on implementing your plan. Sometimes the trick to resolving blocks is to recognize how a completely different solution, one that is not blocked, can achieve the stated goals.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Stay tuned for Part 2 where we share what actually happened in 2017 and Part 3 where we lay out the 2018 plan, which has us coming full circle in our quest to find the right controller board for Holoseat.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
<p>The year is flying by. Sprint 2 is done and suddenly it is time to get everything ready for SyndCon 2017. Our last sprint was a roller coaster ride, full of mission critical Product Backlog Items (PBIs). On numerous occasions we asked ourselves &#8220;are going to get enough done before this year&#8217;s SyndCon?&#8221;  Fortunately, we applied all of the lessons learned from previous sprints and delivered exactly what we needed to lock in the v0.4 design. And I am happy to report we are ready to share our progress with our fellow guild members in August.</p>
<h1>How We Did Last Sprint</h1>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>As we shared in our <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/2017-sprint-2-kick-off-implementing-hid-on-v0-4/">last sprint kick off post</a>, the number one priority for Sprint 2 was to implement the HID keyboard interface through an Arduino based board. We worked hard in planning to ensure we would be successful. One key to our planning was breaking this PBI down into smaller bites.  Thanks to the smaller PBIs we made slow, steady progress.  We also more quickly identified when and where things were not working. Thanks to this planning, we have fully demonstrated the architecture and implementation we will be using for the v0.4 HID keyboard.</p>
<p>It is worth noting another key to this success was our willingness to adapt our implementation to suit the technology stacks the rest of the CHIP Pro community is adopting. It turns out our initial implementation plan had some hits and misses. For example, we correctly identified <a href="https://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-supported-on-chip-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker as a useful technology for the CHIP Pro</a>, but it is <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/boards/36/topics/1263?r=1268#message-1268">lacking in key documentation</a>. On the other hand, our initial decision to go with Node.js was not sustainable. There is just not enough community support for the combined CHIP/CHIP Pro platform for Node.js related projects. So, we have moved to the language of CHIP IoT development, Python, for the v0.4 firmware.</p>
<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>Overall we had a very good sprint. We accomplished what we needed and demonstrated an improved level of teamwork. That does not mean the sprint was without its challenges. Both Bryan and I had outside blocks at the same time due to work and family demands. This led to our missing several stand up meetings in a row mid-sprint. And, despite how well the sprint ended, the implementation details for the HID keyboard interface looked like they would not be completed as late as week 6 of 8.</p>
<p>Yet, as we noted in our <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/news/77">retrospective meeting</a> the theme of Sprint 2 was recovery. Unlike past sprints, we recognized the pattern of missed stand up meetings and immediately resumed meeting. Further, our improved teamwork helped us identify the sticking points around the HID keyboard research.  We were then able to select the proper path forward, leading to a surge in productivity the last two weeks and the successful completion of the sprint.</p>
<p>Bryan and I also identified a new lesson at the close of Sprint 2. The two of us have reached the limit on how much work we can take on in any given sprint. If we want (or need) to take on more work than we have been doing, we <strong>must</strong> bring in outside resources. These outside resources can include volunteers or contractors.</p>
<h1>What We Are Doing This Sprint</h1>
<p>The Sprint 3 plan can be summed up in one word, SyndCon. Every PBI is directly related to getting ready to demo and present our progress toward v0.4 at SyndCon. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing the <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/boards/36/topics/1256?r=1258#message-1258">new sensors we have selected</a></li>
<li>upgrading our demo hardware to showcase improved sensitivity and packaging</li>
<li>creating a professional, scripted demo process (complete with signage and dedicated demonstration games)</li>
<li>bringing Holoseat swag to give out at SyndCon</li>
<li>creating our presentations for SyndCon</li>
</ul>
<p>In case this looks like a lot of work for 7 weeks (yes we are running a truncated sprint), that is because it is. Based on our final lesson from Sprint 2, the Sprint 3 plan includes calling on outside resources to help us get the job done. And, the good news is they have all accepted.  You can see the full list of PBIs on our Sprint 3 plan (click the Sprint 3 tab) and our complete backlog (click the Backlog tab) in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jqOwehWnSD8kbHw8bYQPMaTnqAzL6WM20qazQUJKRWQ/pubhtml">2017 planning document</a>.</p>
