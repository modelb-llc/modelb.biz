In its earliest form, when it resembled parts from Radio Shack cobbled together, you could see its potential. Today, as it undergoes its alpha test, it is looking and feeling more like a consumer grade product. We are excited to see it emerge from alpha and make its way to the market and hope to see them back at SyndCon 2019. ~ <em>Sean Stalzer, Syndicate Founder and President<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_556\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-556\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-556\" src=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Assembled-Holoseat-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Assembled Holoseat v1 Alpha\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Assembled-Holoseat-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Assembled-Holoseat-768x433.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Assembled-Holoseat-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Assembled-Holoseat-580x327.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assembled Holoseat v1 Alpha<\/p><\/div>\n<p>With the launch of the Alpha we felt it was time to get a version back in the raffle.\u00a0Two <a href=\"https:\/\/deskcycle.com\/\">Deskcycles<\/a>, our preferred and at this time only certified exercise equipment, were put into the raffle along with a Holoseat alpha kit for each.\u00a0 We are very happy to report two members snatched up the Holoseats early on in the raffle.\u00a0 Even better, both winners have chosen to join our Alpha test!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Once more August meant it was time for Holoseat&#8217;s annual pilgrimage to SyndCon.\u00a0 This year we brought a little more than just our usual upgraded test hardware and presentations.\u00a0\u00a0For the first time since 2014 we brought something for&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":555,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[55,57,47],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 -
