Since this is still development prototype, I wanted to source components which can be bread boarded using a prototype shield and mini-breadboard. The previous version of the *Holoseat* was built using this approach, and I find it creates a usable, near finished product while maintaining the flexibility of bench top breadboarding. And, since my soldering skills leave something to be desired, I wanted to find a pre-assembled prototype shield (which, unfortunately ruled out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/51\">Adafruit&#8217;s Prototype Shield<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Since I am an Amazon Prime member, I often turn to Amazon for my initial search for almost everything. And, it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of Arduino related products on Amazon. As I was searching for prototype shields, I quickly came across <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SainSmart-Prototyping-Prototype-Breadboard-arduino\/dp\/B0079WI2MK\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379362952&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sainsmart+prototype+shield\">this one<\/a> (see image below) from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sainsmart.com\/\">SainSmart<\/a>. It looked like a pretty good deal. It&#8217;s a good price and includes jumper wires for use with the breadboard.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51PTiDqW6XL._SX385_.jpg\" alt=\"SainSmart Arduino Prototype Shield\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As I wrapped up the BOM and I continued looking around Amazon, I came across this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SainSmart-Leonardo-Tutorial-Instruction-Projects\/dp\/B00CXE5KQU\/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379362857&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=leonardo+kit\">Intro to Arduino Kit<\/a> which includes a Leonardo board (see the <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/wiki\/Detailed_Design?version=6\">Detailed Design<\/a> for info on why we are moving to the Leonardo). Now this was very tempting. It includes pretty much everything from the <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/wiki\/BOM?version=3\">BOM<\/a> plus extra stuff for later experimentation, and at a nearly $20 savings over ordering components individually. Needless to say, I was pretty excited. But, I am thorough shopper, and truth be told I was not familiar with SainSmart. So, I decided to do some Googling to make sure this was really as good a deal as it seems. Boy am I glad I did.<\/p>\n<p>At first, I didn&#8217;t find much info one way or another. There were a couple of somewhat negative forum posts which I didn&#8217;t find very helpful on their own. But then I came across <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/arduino\/comments\/16slmd\/arduino_pins_protoshield_and_sainsmart_motorshield\/\">this thread<\/a> on Reddit. It looks like SainSmart is not being a good OSHW citizen (note, I have nothing against cloners, but I do have a problem with people not following license and trademark requirements, let alone changing components without proper documentation). Combined with the few bits I could gather from the other forum posts, I just cannot justify going with SainSmart for any components until I hear better news about their behavior with regards to OSHW.<\/p>\n<p>So, back to Amazon and Google I went looking for a prototype shield. The good news is the Arduino team has an assembled shield which Amazon sells. Plus, there is a mini-breadboard at Amazon which looks like it should fit on the shield. A few quick adjustments to the Bill of Materials, and it was done. Now it&#8217;s time to order parts.
