went for us.\u00a0 This year&#8217;s objectives were all about expanding our presence, introducing Holoseat v0.4, and priming the pump for our upcoming alpha test.\u00a0 Despite some last minute changes in our development plans, we scored on all three of those objectives.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_330\" style=\"width: 522px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

traditional presentations, we added dedicated demo Space for Holoseat.\u00a0 Our &#8220;booth&#8221; included two demo units and all new signage.\u00a0 The demo units (shown above) showcased the v0.4 design with upgraded sensors and an all-in-one configuration.\u00a0 Plus we pre-sold v0.4 builds of Holoseat to seven alpha testers!\u00a0 As always, it was a great SyndCon.\u00a0 Keep reading for lots of pictures and more details on this year&#8217;s con-venture.<\/p>\n<h1>Austin Bound<\/h1>\n<p>This year&#8217;s SyndCon was held in Austin, TX and getting Holoseat there presented a whole new challenge.\u00a0 In previous years at least one of us drove, simplifying the transportation logistics for Holoseat.\u00a0 But this year, Bryan and I flew to Austin together.<\/p>\n<div

course, TSA decided to have a look at Holoseat.\u00a0 Maybe next time we will have to leave them a note with a link to our website.\u00a0 \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<h1>Feet on Demos<\/h1>\n<p>We ran about 50 demos this year, with 60% of those demos to first time users.\u00a0 The vast majority of users, new and old, were thrilled with Holoseat&#8217;s upgrades.\u00a0 Many commented on the game play related improvements.\u00a0 The only group of players with significant concerns about Holoseat were FPS players who wanted to see even greater sensitivity from Holoseat.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_335\"

user demographics we have seen.\u00a0 Young and old alike gave Holoseat a try, many playing through multiple levels of Portal 2 (this year&#8217;s demo game), well beyond the expected play time of 5-10 minutes.\u00a0 While we are on the subject of Portal 2, Bryan and I were shocked by how few fellow guild mates had never played Portal.\u00a0 Seriously, we thought everyone had played Portal at some point.<\/p>\n<h1>Project Updates<\/h1>\n<p>Holoseat has come a long way since last year&#8217;s convention.\u00a0 Our latest version, a preview of v0.4,\u00a0 is zeroing in on production design.\u00a0 How so?\u00a0 Holoseat is now an all in one unit with fully integrated electronics built into high quality exercise pedals.\u00a0 This upgraded packaging means Holoseat is ready to use out of the box, just plug it in and start playing.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_338\" style=\"width: 955px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-338\"
