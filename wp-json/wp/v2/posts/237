\u00a0I am happy to <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/boards\/36\/topics\/1217?r=1230#message-1230\">report<\/a> we completed all <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog\" target=\"_blank\">Product Backlog<\/a> Items (PBIs) for Sprint 6. \u00a0In even better news, the Sprint 6 work also resulted in v0.3 receiving its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/exciting-start-to-2017-holoseat-is-certified-as-open-source-hardware\/\">certification as OSHW<\/a>. \u00a0Not only does the work publicly demonstrate our commitment to open source hardware, it also taught us invaluable lessons about the state of the project. \u00a0We learned what features are ready to go (e.g our cadence calculation algorithm). \u00a0We also identified the features which need some tweaking (like the <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/issues\/276\">logic voltage bug<\/a> with our sensors). \u00a0Finally, we discovered which features need significant development for v0.4 (the most critical of which is the <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/boards\/36\/topics\/1231\">controller hardware<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/issues\/276\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/attachments\/download\/632\" alt=\"SparkFun Logic Level Converter (CHIP Pro for Scale)\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fix for Logic Voltage Bug &#8211; SparkFun Logic Level Converter (CHIP Pro for Scale)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>And what lessons did we learn during Sprint 6? \u00a0One of the major lessons was that we got a little lucky. \u00a0Life finally settled down for both of us after the insanity that was Sprint 5, which was a significant part of why we were able to complete all of our PBIs. \u00a0But, we also recognize we planned well and that going forward, solid planning would be key to successful sprints. \u00a0That is why we took our time in developing the road map for 2017 and preparing the Sprint 1 plan.<\/p>\n<h1>What We Are Doing This Sprint<\/h1>\n<p>Speaking of 2017&#8217;s first\u00a0sprint, let&#8217;s take a look at what is on the plan. \u00a0Sprint 1 started on Feb 22 and runs through April 19. \u00a0The sprint covers administrative items necessary to keep Model B running, development items to address the highest priority questions about v0.4, and planning items for the beta testing crowd source campaign. \u00a0That sounds like a lot, but we measured twice before committing to the sprint plan and we feel confident this list is just the right size. \u00a0You can see the full list of PBIs on our Sprint 1 plan (click the Sprint 1 tab) and our complete backlog (click the Backlog tab) in our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1jqOwehWnSD8kbHw8bYQPMaTnqAzL6WM20qazQUJKRWQ\/pubhtml\">2017 planning document<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As always, be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/newsletter-signup\/\">sign up for our newsletter<\/a> to keep up on all things Holoseat. \u00a0And you can follow the week to week details of this, and future sprints, on the Holoseat project <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/news\">News page<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/news.atom?key=4fad3204e4725c1db27eb4400dca128e87eba5ab\">Atom feed<\/a>).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is the first in a series of blog posts covering Holoseat&#8217;s development. \u00a0Look for one at the start of each sprint covering where we have been and where we are going.
