Look for one at the start of each sprint covering where we have been and where we are going.<\/i><\/p>\n<h1>The Big Picture<\/h1>\n<p>We just <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/news\/69\">wrapped up Sprint 1<\/a> of 2017 and <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/news\/70\">spun up Sprint 2<\/a>. \u00a0As anticipated, Sprint 1 was a busy sprint, full of technical, business, and crowd source campaign Product Backlog Items (PBIs). \u00a0The Sprint 1 plan was designed to move us toward our dual 2017 goals: \u00a0finalize the v0.4 hardware and to set up Holoseat\u2019s beta testing. \u00a0We also had several administrative tasks related to running the LLC and making sure our business systems are healthy. \u00a0These administrative tasks were just as important as meeting our plan as they included minor details like taxes and mandatory reporting. \u00a0<em>Just remember everyone, running an open source hardware startup is not all hacking and fun.<\/em> \u00a0You also have to do all those things they teach business majors.<\/p>\n<h1>How We Did Last Sprint<\/h1>\n<h2>Review<\/h2>\n<p>Now it is time to report on how we did during Sprint 1. \u00a0If this was a football game, I would say we only managed to score a field goal. \u00a0While we completed most of our PBIs and managed to keep up a steady pace during most of the sprint, we fell noticeably short of the end zone.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining work on one of the PBIs is so small it is laughable that we did not complete it. \u00a0We literally just need to get the correct set of signatures on one last document to claim done on BIZ-07. \u00a0On the other hand, failing to complete DEV-06 is a significant setback. \u00a0The goal of DEV-06 was to test our ability to implement Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard emulation from our new controller board. \u00a0Until we have HID keyboard emulation working, nearly all other development is blocked until we fix this.<\/p>\n<p>But fear not, all is not as dire as it may sound. \u00a0First, we have a fallback implementation in mind that has low development risk. \u00a0Second, our research into crowd source campaigns has taught us about campaign timing and marketing. \u00a0As a result of these lessons we are adjusting our goals for 2017. \u00a0Instead of pushing through with our plan for a crowd funded beta test program, we are going to build up Holoseat&#8217;s marketing reach. \u00a0Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/contact\/\">drop us a line<\/a> if you would like to volunteer as part of our marketing team (we are looking at you, social media natives).<\/p>\n<h2>Retrospective<\/h2>\n<p>All of which takes us to our lessons learned during Sprint 1. \u00a0First, let&#8217;s take a look at the good news. \u00a0Despite the one major setback, we are pleased with how the planning and day-to-day management of the sprint worked. \u00a0We selected the right amount (and generally the right kind) of work. \u00a0We also maintained a pretty even pace throughout the sprint. \u00a0However, we still fell behind on\u00a0documentation a couple of times. \u00a0New processes have been put in place help us\u00a0stay current where documentation is concerned going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the big lessons are all about DEV-06. \u00a0The first lesson is to &#8220;stick to the plan!&#8221; \u00a0It turns out the Sprint 1 plan had an escape hatch for DEV-06: \u00a0DEV-07 (implement HID keyboard interface via an Arduino based board, like our previous controller the Feather). \u00a0However, we failed to leverage this part of our plan, at all. \u00a0We won&#8217;t be making that mistake again.<\/p>\n<p>The other major take away from DEV-06 is that we planned the HID keyboard development backwards. \u00a0We should have started with the safe bet (DEV-07 and its reliance on technology we have been using from almost day one) and only moved on to the more challenging implementation after we had a working solution. \u00a0This way, if we had gotten to the end of the sprint and we had only completed DEV-07, we would still have a working implementation for \u00a0v0.4. \u00a0We can always come back later and improve the design with the more challenging implementation.<\/p>\n<h1>What We Are Doing This Sprint<\/h1>\n<p>So, what can you expect from Sprint 2? \u00a0First and foremost, you can expect DEV-07 to be completed. \u00a0We are also experimenting with a couple of potential architecture changes for the Holoseat controller. \u00a0The first change is possibly using <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hypriot.com\/post\/docker-supported-on-chip-computer\/\">Docker on the CHIP<\/a> Pro to <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/boards\/36\/topics\/1263\">make it easier to set up the software stack<\/a>. \u00a0The second potential change is moving the controller hardware down to the exercise equipment. \u00a0And of course, we are going to get that last set of signatures for our paperwork and continue to improve our documentation. \u00a0You can see the full list of PBIs on our Sprint 2 plan (click the Sprint 2 tab) and our complete backlog (click the Backlog tab) in our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1jqOwehWnSD8kbHw8bYQPMaTnqAzL6WM20qazQUJKRWQ\/pubhtml\">2017 planning document<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As always, be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/newsletter-signup\/\">sign up for our newsletter<\/a> to keep up on all things Holoseat. \u00a0And you can follow the week to week details of this, and future sprints, on the Holoseat project <a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/news\">News page<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/opendesignengine.net\/projects\/holoseat\/news.atom?key=4fad3204e4725c1db27eb4400dca128e87eba5ab\">Atom feed<\/a>).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post is part of a series covering Holoseat\u2019s development.
