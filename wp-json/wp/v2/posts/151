Our next public activity was a presentation slot in the annual guild meeting, including a live demo of Holoset by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starr_Long\" target=\"_blank\">Starr Long<\/a> in front of the entire convention. \u00a0Starr was quite impressed by the Holoseat as you can tell from the picture below. \u00a0Finally, I was\u00a0interviewed for the <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.libsyn.com\/episode\/index\/show\/molds2\/id\/4691455\" target=\"_blank\">MOLDS episode 2<\/a>. \u00a0As you can tell, we all had a blast during the interview.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_177\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-177\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-177 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20160827_104837668-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Starr Long's Holoseat Demo @ SyndCon 2016\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20160827_104837668-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20160827_104837668-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20160827_104837668-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.modelb.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20160827_104837668-1-580x326.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-177\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Starr Long&#8217;s Holoseat Demo @ SyndCon 2016<\/p><\/div>\n<p>On top of our scheduled public activities, we ran many, many demos. \u00a0The demos gave us a chance to get real world feedback about Holoseat (both live and through the surveys).
