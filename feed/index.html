										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Week two, still working out the plan for Holoseat v2.  We have our epics defined, and a good idea of our priorities.  Things are going slower than in the past, but between busy lives and a three hour time difference it is a pace we can maintain.  A new tool to keep us organized, and more careful planning to allow for our limited time to be used as best we can.</p>



<h3><strong>New Tool</strong></h3>



<p>Good chance people recognize the tool in the screenshot.  We&#8217;re shifting our planning out of a custom Google Sheets document and into Jira.  Why the change?  Easier to access, easier to work with, and most importantly, it&#8217;s a tool we both use for work at this point so we know it pretty well.</p>



<h3>Last Meeting</h3>



<p>This past meeting we tweaked our original list of goals for v2.0 and decided on priorities.  We also decided that meeting weekly for this stretch of Thursday night is working well and we&#8217;ll continue for the foreseeable future.  We may change to a less frequent cadence once planning is complete, but until we get everything planned we will continue at the weekly pace.</p>



<h3>Next Meeting</h3>



<p>Much like the last two, we&#8217;re going to continue planning this week.  Now that we have overall goals, we need to setup the stories that define them and the bite size pieces we&#8217;re going to use to eat the elephant.  Planning continues, same bat time same bat channel. Thursday night 9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Eastern (6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Pacific) on our Discord server (leave a comment if you would like to join us). If you don&#8217;t currently have access and would like it, please either reach out to one of us directly or post a comment and we will send you an invite.</p>



<p>Thanks again for all of your continued support!  #ExerfyYourGames</p>

<p>Bryan and I have not closed up shop, we were merely on a hiatus…. Having children and making cross country moves will tend to put a kink in one&#8217;s plans.</p>



<p>That hiatus ends this week. We learned much during the v1.0 Alpha and in the time since then. So much that we have come to realize we need to iterate on a couple of specific elements in the design to make Holoseat more robust and more affordable.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we will be holding a v2 development kickoff meeting this Thursday night 9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Eastern (6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Pacific) on our Discord server (leave a comment if you would like to join us). We will be setting up our Jira project by defining our release goal(s) and setting the top level features (detailed agenda below).</p>



<h3>Agenda</h3>



<ol><li>Define goal(s) for v2.0</li><li>Capture v2.0 Features</li><li>Prioritize v2.0 Features</li><li>Establish meeting cadence</li></ol>



<p>Thanks again for all of your continued support!  #ExerfyYourGames</p>

<p>Two things show up this week in our burn down chart.  One, its total size changed because we found an error in our sprint sizing.  Two, we are moving more slowly than we would like.  Some of our tasks appear undersized, so we will just have to see how much we can actually get done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My original reasons for becoming involved with Holoseat back in 2013 were pretty simple: </p>



<ol><li>I loved playing video games</li><li>I didn&#8217;t get enough exercise</li><li>Overall the concept sounded really cool. </li></ol>



<p>Over the years though,  that has evolved.  To explain why Holoseat is important to me now, I need to talk about my life. I suffer from social anxiety and depression.  </p>



<p>Just typing that was something I couldn&#8217;t have brought myself to do when we started on Holoseat five years ago.  Back then I didn&#8217;t realize how much I was struggling with my mental health.  Thankfully, through the support of my family and friends I realized how much it was affecting me.  </p>



<p>The blogs and podcasts I follow have helped me realize the importance of speaking publicly about my mental health.  Society still heavily sigmatizes those with mental illness in the US. Adding even one more voice to the discussion surrounding mental health is something that is needed.  I&#8217;m willing to add my voice thanks to the influences of Wil Wheaton, Jenny Lawson, and Justin and Syndee McElroy.</p>



<p>Why have my mental health issues changed my motivations to work on Holoseat?  The answer is simple and very well documented.  <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm/">Exercise helps</a>, period.  <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise.aspx">Study</a> after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495">study</a> has shown that symptoms of both anxiety and depression can be relieved through exercise.  Since I&#8217;m not one who&#8217;s likely to exercise as much as I should, having my normally sedentary hobby include a workout is huge win.  Prior to having our child, I got up every morning and used the Holoseat for an hour to get in some gaming.  I mean a workout.  That resulted not only in weight loss but overall better mental health.</p>



<p>The percentage of people I know who identify as gamers who also have issues with anxiety and depression is pretty high. Many of those same people also admit don&#8217;t get enough exercise. By providing an outlet that combines something the person enjoys (gaming) and exercise it makes them more likely to get the exercise they need. </p>



<p>So why Holoseat?  Because depression and anxiety suck, and using the Holoseat to exerfy games gives you another weapon in your arsenal to combat them.  That I&#8217;m helping to create another weapon is what motivates me to work on Holoseat.</p>



<p>Exercise can be a weapon to combat these issues, but being open and honest about how they are affecting you is also important.  I want to personally thank the people who have helped me and inspired me to be open about this. Your frank discussions of mental health have helped me get to this point.</p>



<ul><li>Wil Wheaton &#8211; Thank you for your discussions of mental health both on your blog and on the Radio Free Burrito podcast &#8211; <a href="http://wilwheaton.net/">http://wilwheaton.net/</a><br></li><li>Jenny Lawson &#8211; Your openness and honesty about mental health is inspiring &#8211; <a href="https://thebloggess.com/">https://thebloggess.com/</a><br></li><li>Justin and Sydnee McElroy &#8211; Your podcast episode on Sawbones (<a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/sawbones/sawbones-our-mental-health-stories">Our Mental Health Stories</a>) was the catalyst for this post. Justin mentioned exercise being something that helped, but that finding motivation was hardbecause he didn&#8217;t enjoy it.  That one statement reminded me why I feel Holoseat is important.</li><li>Finally, my wife Jess.  My biggest cheerleader, my drill sergeant, my inspiration, and my best friend.  Without you I probably still wouldn&#8217;t have recognized my mental health issues, let alone be willing to talk about them.  </li></ul>

<p>It has been a while since we posted, but we are back now (and back in sprint mode).  This sprint is primarily focused on moving from our Alpha design to our Beta design and some new marketing initiatives.  The first step in the redesign work is to update our project hosting to make it easier to track modifications to the design.</p>

<p>If you are in the area, you should check out the Con!  Bril and our newest Holoseat community member, Vox, will be around Friday and Saturday.  They will be running Holoseat demos (like in the video above) both days.  And, as an added bonus, Bryan and I will be attending via telecon Saturday to host a live panel discussion about Holoseat.</p>
<p>Thanks again for setting this up, Bril!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first third of our 2019 planning year is coming to a close and it is time for our first Review/Retrospective covering the last two months of work.  After this, we will go dark for December to enjoy the holidays and rest up before the second third of our planning year (January &#8211; April).</p>
<p>With our work transitioning from development to testing and marketing, we have shifted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_Sprint">Scrum based sprints</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a> based iterations.  This post will cover the results and lessons from two Kanbans, 1.1 and 1.2.  As always, you can get all the details by from our <a href="https://www.modelb.biz/category/stand-ups/">weekly stand ups</a>.</p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>Agile reviews are an opportunity to hold ourselves accountable by identifying how much of what we planned we actually completed.</p>
<h2>Claiming Done</h2>

<li>Build Facebook community around Alpha Testers (dropped from plan, going to rework the plan)</li>
<li>Wrap up final paperwork related to Alpha Test</li>
</ul>
<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<p>Agile retrospectives are the means by which we &#8220;inspect and adapt&#8221;.  This is our chance to promote what works and adjust what does not.</p>
<h2>What went well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Great first guest blog post</li>
<li>Good use of research into moving businesses between states turned into huge time savings in the process (domestication vs reincorporation)</li>
<li>Good use of inspect and adapt mid-iteration around use of social media when planned activities were not working</li>
<li>Did a good job of sticking to PY19 goals of focusing on marketing and business (notice we did not claim done on any technical items in this iteration)</li>
<li>Happy with how the testimonials page/How I Holoseat combo turned out</li>
<li>Our unfinished work is predominantly items that were blocked or we reworked the plan (vs just things we did not get around to)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What did not go well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We really must improve how we go about doing social media and marketing</li>
<li>Uneven distribution of workload due to extenuating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<h2>What can we do better?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bring a marketer on board</li>
<li>Try moving to 2 stand ups per week during PY19 Kanban 2.1 and evaluate if this helps with workload distribution</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Thanksgiving is right around the corner and we are getting ready to take a short break before the final push this iteration.  Over a third of the remaining work is blocked on paperwork from the state of Virginia, so we may not close out everything on the list if we don&#8217;t hear from them in time.  If that turns out to be the case we will just wrap that administrative work up in December.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we are collecting some great test data and our testers are doing wonderful things like <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&amp;participantID=330578">raising money for children&#8217;s hospitals on Holoseat</a>.  We cannot express how thankful we are for our testers and everything they are doing.</p>
